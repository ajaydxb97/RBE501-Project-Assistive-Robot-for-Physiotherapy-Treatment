# RBE501 Project: Assistive Robot System for Upper Limb Physiotherapy Treatment of Stroke Patients
This is a course project for Fall 2019 RBE501 Robot Dynamics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute

The goal of this project is to develop a robot system that assists stroke patients in performing physiotherapy exercises for the arm by guiding them back to the the desired exercise trajectory when they divert. We plan to build this system in simulation using the Asynchronous Multi-Body Framework (AMBF). We model a human arm and use the 7-degree of freedom (DOF) KUKA as the assistive robot.
